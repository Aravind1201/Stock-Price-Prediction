# Stock-Price-Prediction
This is a model for forecasting the Stock Values which was developed by using Basic Machine Learning and Python

We all have heard the word stock one way or the other. Particularly stock is related with the associates and companies which are commercialized and are to settling in the world of marketization. Stock price prediction is an attempt to forecast the future value of an individual stock, a particular sector or the market, or the market as a whole. In Stock Price Prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic. The paper focuses on the use of LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) based Machine learning to predict stock values. LTSMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network for learning long-term dependencies. It is commonly used for processing and predicting time-series data.
